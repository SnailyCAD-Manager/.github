# SnailyCAD Manager Projects

As of now, all SnailyCAD Manager projects are archived. I no longer have the time to continue working on them. While I had previously mentioned that I was working on SnailyCAD Manager v3, it is no longer being actively developed. v3 was close to being ready for release, but I never got around to polishing it.

Both v2 and v3 are available on GitHub:
- [v2 Repository](https://github.com/SnailyCAD-Manager/v2)
- [v3 Repository](https://github.com/SnailyCAD-Manager/v3)

Feel free to fork either version if you'd like to continue working on them. v2 uses very outdated methods and has a messy codebase, while v3 uses relatively outdated libraries and frameworks, including MantineUI, which is no longer my preferred choice of UI library.

Thank you for your understanding.
